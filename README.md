# stancode_Assignment

Assignment:
- [class_review.py](https://github.com/IdrisChen/stancode_Assignment/blob/main/Assignment/demo/class_reviews.png) : At the beginning of this program, the user is asked to input the class name (either SC001 or SC101). If the user input "-1" for class name, your program would show the maximum, minimum, and average among all the inputs.
- [hailstone.py](https://github.com/IdrisChen/stancode_Assignment/blob/main/Assignment/demo/hailstone.png) : This program should implement a console program that simulates the execution of the Hailstone sequence, defined by Douglas Hofstadter.
- [prime_checker.py](https://github.com/IdrisChen/stancode_Assignment/blob/main/Assignment/demo/prime_checker.png) : This program asks our user for input and checks if the input is a prime number or not.
- [quadratic_solver.py](https://github.com/IdrisChen/stancode_Assignment/blob/main/Assignment/demo/quadratic_solver.png) : This program should implement a console program that asks 3 inputs (a, b, and c) from users to compute the roots of equation : ax^2 + bx + c = 0
- [weather_master.py](https://github.com/IdrisChen/stancode_Assignment/blob/main/Assignment/demo/weather_master.png) : This program should implement a console program that asks weather data from user to compute the average, highest, lowest, cold days among the inputs.
